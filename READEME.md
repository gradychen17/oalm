# OpenALM/Tuleap CLI

Tuleap, 100% open source agile and software development tool. Refer to [www.tuleap.org](www.tuleap.org) for more information.

OpenALM is customization of [Tuleap](www.tuleap.org) so it provide Tuleap API(REST API).

In the place where I work, it helps teams to deliver awesome applications, better, faster and easier.  It enables you to plan, track, code and collaborate on software projects.


*oalm* is a command line for OpenALM/Tuleap. The CLI use Tuleap API to create, update, delete artifact that used to track issues/incidents/tickets. It's like a ticket tracking system in our case. 

I developed this command line because the WebUI of OpenALM/Tuleap isn't very efficient when you have to manage many tickets. You need to click multiple times for each artifact on the webUI which is time-consuming. 

With this CLI, create or update the artifacts are very simple.

For security reasons, hostnames of OpenALM server is changed to `openalm.example.com`. Feel free to change it according to your company's requirement.
